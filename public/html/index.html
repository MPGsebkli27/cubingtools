                <h1>Your One-Stop Destination for All Your Cubing Needs</h1>
                <p>Welcome to CubingTools, the resource for cubers of all levels, designed to simplify and
                    enhance your cubing experience. To anyone who might stumble upon this website, CubingTools is here
                    to make your life easier by streamlining tasks that can otherwise
                    be tedious and time-consuming.</p>
                <p>The inspiration for this project came from a challenge I faced while organizing cubing events. The
                    official groupifier website, which you can explore <a
                        href="https://groupifier.jonatanklosko.com/">here</a>, is fantastic but only
                    supports grouping for official World Cube Association (WCA) competitions. This limitation became a
                    significant obstacle for anyone looking to host larger, unofficial competitions on platforms like <a
                        href="https://cubingtools.com/">CubingContents.com</a>, where the grouping process had to be
                    done manually. Recognizing this gap, I decided to create CubingTools to fill the void and provide a
                    more efficient solution for the community.</p>
                <p>As CubingTools developed, it quickly grew beyond being just a basic grouping tool. One of the
                    standout features we've introduced is the Mini Guildford Optimizer. This tool is designed
                    specifically to help you fine-tune the distribution of events during a Mini Guildford challenge. By
                    analyzing key factors such as your most recent official Ao12, the optimizer carefully calculates the
                    optimal global and transition periods. The result is a highly efficient distribution that
                    ensures a seamless and enjoyable experience for all participants.</p>
                <p>Over time, CubingTools has grown significantly, expanding its capabilities to meet the diverse needs
                    of the cubing community. I'm thrilled to share this platform with you and hope it will become an
                    invaluable resource, making it easier than ever to organize, participate in, and enjoy cubing
                    events. From managing large-scale unofficial competitions to fine-tuning your Mini Guildford
                    strategy, CubingTools is here to support every aspect of your cubing journey.</p>
